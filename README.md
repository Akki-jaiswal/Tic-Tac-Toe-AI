# üéÆ Tic-Tac-Toe AI Game

A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented with an Artificial Intelligence opponent using the Minimax algorithm. Challenge the AI and see if you can win!

## ‚ú® Features

* **Player vs. AI Mode:** Play against a smart AI that aims for the best possible move.
* **Minimax Algorithm:** The AI leverages the Minimax algorithm to make optimal decisions, making it a challenging opponent.
* **Intuitive User Interface:** Simple and clean interface for easy gameplay.
* **Game State Detection:** Automatically detects wins, losses, and draws.

## üöÄ How to Play

1.  **Open `index.html`:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2.  **Make Your Move:** Click on any empty square on the Tic-Tac-Toe board to place your 'X'.

4.  **Win, Lose, or Draw:** The game will announce the winner or a draw when conditions are met.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **HTML:** For the basic structure of the game board.
* **CSS:** For styling and visual presentation.
* **JavaScript:** For game logic, user interaction, and implementing the AI.

## üß† Minimax Algorithm Explained (Briefly)

The AI in this game uses the **Minimax algorithm**, a decision-making algorithm used in game theory. It works by:

* **Recursively exploring all possible future moves** from the current game state.
* **Assigning scores** to terminal game states (win, lose, draw).
* **Maximizing** its own score (AI wants to win) and **Minimizing** the opponent's score (AI wants to prevent the player from winning).
* By looking ahead, the AI tries to choose the move that leads to the best possible outcome for itself, assuming the opponent also plays optimally.
